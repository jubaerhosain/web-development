I'll leave the choice upto you by quoting few points:

Bootstrap 4:

Stable. You can consume in full without any issues.
Large community. In case if you face issues, you can resolve them easily.
A liitle bit outdates on introduction to BS5.
Bootstrap 5:

Alpha phase. Basically testing phase.
Lots of new and cool features
Small community. If you face any issues, you will have to figure out the solutions on your own.
Latest. Being up to date with current technologies is cool.
So my take, in case if you want to build a heavy project please use BS4 and in case you want to fun-learn go for BS5 and wait for its complete release. ðŸ˜Š
