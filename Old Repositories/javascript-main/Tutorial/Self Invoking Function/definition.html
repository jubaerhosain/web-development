<!-- In JavaScript, a “Self-Invoking” function is a type of function that is invoked or called 
automatically after its definition. The execution of such an anonymous function is done by 
enclosing it in a parenthesis set followed by another set of parenthesis. -->

<script>
    (function (parameters) {
        //body of the function
    })(arguments);
</script>
