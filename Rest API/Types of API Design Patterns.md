# Types of API design patterns

Following are some of the commonly used API design patterns:

1. RESTful API:

-   Uses HTTP methods to interact with resources
-   Supports caching and scalability
-   Works well for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
-   Allows for stateless communication between client and server
-   Can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks

2. RPC API:

-   Uses Remote Procedure Calls to interact with a remote server
-   Typically requires a protocol or API definition, such as Protobuf or gRPC
-   Can be more efficient than RESTful API in terms of network usage
-   Can be more difficult to implement and maintain

3. GraphQL API:

-   Allows clients to request exactly the data they need
-   Provides a single endpoint for clients to make requests
-   Can reduce the number of requests needed to get all required data
-   Can be more complex to implement than RESTful API
-   May require additional tooling and libraries

4. SOAP API:

-   Uses a messaging protocol to exchange structured information
-   Can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks
-   Can support more complex operations than RESTful API
-   Can be more difficult to implement and maintain

5. Hypermedia API:

-   Includes links between resources, allowing for dynamic discovery and navigation
-   Can improve the flexibility and adaptability of an API
-   May require additional tooling and libraries
-   Can be more difficult to implement and maintain

6. Event-driven API:

-   Sends notifications to clients when certain events occur
-   Can reduce the need for clients to repeatedly poll for updates
-   Can be useful for real-time applications
-   Can be more difficult to implement and maintain

7. Message Queue API:

-   Allows applications to send and receive messages asynchronously
-   Can provide a reliable and scalable way to process messages
-   Can be useful for distributed systems
-   May require additional infrastructure and tooling
