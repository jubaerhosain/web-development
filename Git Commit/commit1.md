Here's a breakdown of a good Git commit message convention:

**Structure:**

* **Subject Line (mandatory):**
    * Start with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "fix", "add", "refactor").
    * Keep it concise (around 50 characters).
    * Capitalize the first letter but don't end with a period.
    * Optionally, use a scope in parenthesis to specify the area of code changed (e.g., `fix(parser): handle edge cases`).
* **Body (optional):**
    * Provide a more detailed explanation of the changes.
    * Use proper grammar and indentation.
    * Wrap text at 72 characters.
* **Footer (optional):**
    * Include references to related issues or breaking changes.
    * Use a specific prefix like "BREAKING CHANGE:" to highlight breaking changes.

**Elements:**

* **Types:** Use keywords to denote the type of change:
    * `feat`: New feature
    * `fix`: Bug fix
    * `refactor`: Code improvements without new features or bug fixes
    * `docs`: Documentation changes
    * `test`: Adding or updating tests
    * `chore`: Build process or tooling changes
* **Scope:** (Optional) Specify the section of the codebase affected by the change within parenthesis (e.g., `fix(auth): permission issue`).

**Examples:**

* `fix: handle null values in search query`
* `feat(dashboard): add new chart type`
* `refactor(code): improve code readability`
* `docs: update API reference for new method`

**Benefits:**

* Clearer understanding of code changes for everyone.
* Easier navigation through project history.
* Improved collaboration and code review.
* Compatibility with automated tooling.

**Additional Tips:**

* Agree on a convention with your team and enforce it with tools like commit hooks.
* Keep messages informative but not too verbose.
* Focus on the "what" and "why" of the changes.

By following these conventions, you can create clear and informative commit messages that benefit your entire development team.
