Certainly! A well-structured commit message is essential for maintaining clarity and coherence within a project. Here's a convention for writing Git commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Let's break down each part:

1. **Type**: Describes the kind of change being made. It should be one of the following:

   - feat: A new feature
   - fix: A bug fix
   - docs: Documentation changes
   - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (whitespace, formatting, etc.)
   - refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
   - test: Adding or correcting tests
   - chore: Changes to the build process, auxiliary tools, or maintenance tasks

2. **Scope**: Indicates the scope of the change. It could be a module, a component, a file, etc.

3. **Subject**: A brief, imperative tense description of the change. It should be clear and concise, not exceeding 50 characters. 

4. **Body**: A more detailed explanation of the changes. It should provide context about why the change was made and any relevant details. It's optional if the subject line is clear enough.

5. **Footer**: Additional information related to the commit. It can include references to issues, tasks, or even breaking changes. Use "Closes #issue" or "Fixes #issue" to automatically close an issue when the commit is merged.

Here's an example:

```
feat(user-profile): Add ability to upload profile picture

- Implemented file upload functionality using Multer
- Added UI components for uploading and displaying profile picture

Closes #123
```

Remember, consistency is key when using this convention across your project to ensure clarity and ease of understanding for collaborators.
